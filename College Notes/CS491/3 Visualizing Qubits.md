A Shannon bit is very easy to visualize
	It's either a 1 or a 0

Qubits are a bit harder to hit

The space of all complex lines through the origin is called the complex projective space and is denoted CP^1 where C is any complex number and P is the projected space

We can use this to visualize a Qubit as a surface of a sphere

In our real world (Think looking down a train track rail) we follow that line as a part of RP^2 where R is any real number and P is the projected space

A complex line is defined as:

Where Lambda is any complex number
Bloch Sphere

Drawing a line between a point and the north pole (Ket 1) creates a stereographic projection of your point.
