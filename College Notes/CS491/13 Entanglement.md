$\ket\psi = \frac{00 - 11}{\sqrt2}$
Prop: $\ket\psi$ is entangled
Proof: (by contradiction)
Assume $\ket\psi$ is not entangled
ergo by definition of entanglement, this can be written in the form:
$\frac1{\sqrt2}(00-11) = \ket\psi = (a\ket0 + b\ket1)(a\ket0 + b\ket1) = a_\alpha00 + a_\beta01 + b_\alpha10 + b_\beta11$

$a\alpha = \frac1{\sqrt2}$
$a\beta = 0$
$b\alpha = 0$
$b\beta = \frac1{\sqrt2}$

In this case, either
a is 0, $\beta$ is 0, b is 0 or $\alpha$ is 0
Case a = 0
$a\alpha = \frac1{\sqrt2} => 0 = \frac1{\sqrt2}$ Impossible
$a\ne0$
Case $\beta$ = 0
$0\ne\frac{-1}{\sqrt2}$ Impossible
Ergo, the assumption is false
Ergo, $\ket\psi$ must be entangled
QED

The detanglement still cannot travel faster than the speed of light.
