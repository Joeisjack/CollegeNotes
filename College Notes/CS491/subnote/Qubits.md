Imagine a coin, heads or tails -> Shannon bit
It can either be HEADS or TAILS

A Qubit lies in a 2D Hilbert space

Basis -> |0>, |1>

Is Orthonormal, i.e. the dot product of the vectors is 0(?)
Perpendicular in a way

|0> \* |1> = <0|1> = (0) = 0

It is essentially the probability of either happening (not a straight 0 or 1)

Cannot be copied


H = Span(|0>, |1>)
