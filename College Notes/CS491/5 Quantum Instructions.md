Quantum Computing instructions:

Unitary Operations -> U     U^-1 = U^Dagger = U^\*T
Hermition Operations -> Ω     Ω^Dagger = Ω

A Hermition Transformation is a measurement of a quantum state
	Converts from spooky quantum info into classical info
	WE DO NOT KNOW THE STATE UNTIL WE MEASURE IT

When measuring, make sure it is of unit length

This is in unit length!

This is the general computational basis aka standard basis

Review diagonalization
A state where the column vectors are that eigenvalues

Spectral Decomposition Theorem
$P_j = \ket{\psi_j} \bra{\psi_j}$
$X=\lambda_{+}P_{+}+\lambda_{-}P_{-}$
