What is an instruction set?
	The repertoire of instructions of a computer
	Different computers have different instruction sets
	Early computers had very simple instructions sets
	Many modern computers also have simple instruction sets

RISC-V Instruction Set
	Used as the example throughout the book
	Developed at UC Berkeley as open ISA
	Now managed by the RISC-V Foundation (riscv.org)
	Typical of many modern ISAs
	Similar ISAs have a large share of embedded core market

Most RISC-V takes three operands
	add a, b, c -> a = b + c
	sub a, b, c -> a = b - c
	etc.
