Vacuum Tubes Exist

In CMOS IC technology
Power = Capacitive load * Voltage^2 * Frequency

Benchmarks are programs used to measure performance
	Though not the be all end all

Amdahl's law
	Improving an aspect of a computer and expecting a proportional improvement in overall performace
	Example:
	Multiply accounts for 80s/100s
		How much improvement in multiply performace to get 5x overall
	20 = (80 / n) + 20
	Can't be done!

Corollary: Make things fast

MIPS: Millions of Instructions Per Second

Doesn't account for
	Differences in ISAs between computers
	Difference in complexity between instructions
	Not a great measure of performance because of things that it does not account for

POWER is a VERY limiting factor
