	Make simpler
Make the common case fast
	Make the usual action faster to operate
Performance via parallelism
	Think using 3 washing machines to wash 3 loads of laundry at the same time
Performance via pipelining
	Overlap the use of resources
	Think of a Wash, Dry, Fold, washing machine assembly line
Performance via prediction
	Predict what could happen before it does
Hierarchy of memories
	Use higher level memories only when necessary
Dependability via redundancy
	Have fail-safes
