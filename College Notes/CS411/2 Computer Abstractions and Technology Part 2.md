Most technology uses LCD screens which mirrors the contents of frame buffer memory

Pixels are in RGBA format

CPU
	Datapath
		Performs operations on data
	Control
		Tells the rest of the CPU what to do with sequences or memory
	Cache Memory
		Small fast SRAM memory for immediate access to data

Abstractions
	Helps up deal with complexity
	Hidden behind Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
	Application Binary Interface (ABI)



Volatile Main Memory
	Loses data when power is off

Non Volatile Secondary Memory
	Magnetic Disk
	Flash Memory
	Optical Disk (CDROM, DVD)


Networks
	Communication, resource sharing, non local access
	Local Area Network (LAN): Ethernet
	Wide Area Network (WAN): Internet

Semiconductors -> Silicon

Measuring Execution Time
	Elapsed time
		Total response time, including all aspects
		Processing, I/O, OS overhead, idle time
	CPU time
		Time spent processing a given job
		Comprises user CPU time and system CPU time
