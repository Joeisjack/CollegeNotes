Operating systems provide an environment for execution of programs and services to programs and users

Things that are helpful to users:
UI (CLI, GUI, Touch Screen)
Program Execution
I/O operations

Linux is CLI with a graphical shell over top
Mac/Win is similar but other way around

File system manipulation (Think file explorer functions)
Communication
Error detection -> If something goes wrong with hardware, software, etc.

Services for the kernel is sent through [[System Calls]]
