What do OS do?
	Users want convenience, ease, and performance
		No cares for resource util
	Shared computers must keep all users happy
		OS is the resource allocater, and control program

Born because computers became general use in military and needed program control/management

Driver -> Translator from device to PC?

Bus -> "Shared Pathway" Think interstate of data

Most CPU actions are through interrupts, switching between actions is called context switching


Bootstrap Programs is loaded at power-up or reboot
	Stored in ROM (Read only) or EPROM (Write once usually) as firmware

Caching
	Copying data into faster storage

Storage Systems organized in hierarchy,
	Speed
	Cost
	Volatility

DMA -> Direct Memory Access


Emulations
	Slowest method
	When not in native code, it is interpreted
Virtualization
	OS natively compiled for CPU, running guest OSes also natively compilied
	Think sandboxing off an area in a playground for an OS
