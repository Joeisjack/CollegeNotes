What is culture?
	Culture is the social concepts and categories people operate in.
	This includes technology, symbols, belief systems, values, norms, ideologies, learned behaviors, and practices that contribute to one's life.
	We should consider culture as characteristics of groups, organizations, and institutions, rather than part of an individual.

Culture has two forms:
	Material
	Non-material/Symbolic
