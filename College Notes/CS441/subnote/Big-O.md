Show 10n is O(n^2). How do we prove this?

We need to show that foreach c, n_0, such that 10\*n <= c\*n^2
Forall n >= n_0

Let c=10, n_0 = 1
Then we need to show that...
10 \* n <= 10 \* n^2 forall n >= 1
 |
 |  Simplify out a "n" from both sides
V
10 <= 10\*n forall n >= 1
 |
V
1 <= n forall n >= 1 ---> YES
