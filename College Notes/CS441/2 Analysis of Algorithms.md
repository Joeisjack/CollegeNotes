Another way of finding the order of growth
Check how the relations of the two function act as n -> inf
When f(n)/g(n)

If this function goes to infinity, f(n) is greater
If this function goes to 0, g(n) is greater
if this function goes to a constant, f(n) and g(n) has the same order of growth

You might need to use l'hopital's rule:

Stirling's formula n=((2 * pi * n)^(1/2)) * (n/e)\^n
